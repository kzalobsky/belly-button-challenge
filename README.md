# belly-button-challenge
 #In this assignment, we built an interactive site that explores a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset from the Rob Dunn lab at North Carolina State University.
 
 #The data looked at the top ten microbial species in over 600 test subjects belly buttons per sample.
 
 #We wanted to create a bar chart that showed the top ten mimcrobial species per subject and then create a buble chart based off of the data for each test subject.
